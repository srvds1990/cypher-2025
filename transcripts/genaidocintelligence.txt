Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Good morning. Hi, that's a welcome. Thank you. So nice. I am from a mental Exp and I' been AI at the company. Mostly the GI have been working on this amazing technology GI comes, Dr. DX said, how American Exp produced documents in their under and other system. And how gener I can think of these processes will be find poor rovers and I can. So before you jump into, why would I give you overview whatancy? I think American Express being a 170, the down and how being r. Doc verification. I think this is a slightly unexpl area, but when the decisions are based on the information from documents, it becomes very critically makes sure that the information that I am on on the documents is auttending has not been modified out. The image you pass, the information extraction I believe is is one of the most explod area where you would try to p e informationmission from the document stabular data or FO text charts, whatnot. And the final, which is one of the most involved tasks is how to extact intelligence of Loutheast data. Some of the examples in this movie would be a visual of Krishnnam Singh. Why this is the most involved process, it is also the most rewarding one will get into it in the same time. Now we understand what are the document understanding tasks. It also have a pul of what type of documentary. And to simplify this, I' not exhausted, but I have invited them into a structure moving to On the left, you see structured documents, which you would even say that do not change your timeies are fixed form documents like tax for, any medical insurance fund that you're looking, and they are easy to process. Why not they the extreme right and site, these are the unstructured, which are the most complicated ones, and are dominating in realities, like contracts, financial statements, which are available in free complex in how to make these j and handle up very different. And in is what I call as any structure document, which Apple fixed limit, let's taken a couple of bank statement, right? You would imagine a bank statement would have a bank transcription description and soth. But why I call them a se? Why do you imagine a layout of a bank statement, but if you look at the bank statement across different banks, they may very not a Facebook form, but somewhat. Now I motivated the use of document AI what documents are there, but why are you talking about it? Why is it so special that we have to get special emphasis to this? So documents are not only texts, by a lot of has onproing texts andSP and so on and so forth. Documents are not seen texts, they are multiodel entities. They have a lot of info graphics, They have tab, they have texts. So it's a multiodal representation of the. which a sp alignment and where the information is sequential that is stopped up would make the meaning of the information. Even for enterprises, we have seen that the incra class generations are food on day, and we talk about grown enterprises and geography, the language, the type of data, the type of documents that are being loose for the same process acrossies, even making this problem more ch. And it's not that talk about understanding on the major document understanding is anex. There has been a lot of research and over decades. But if we talk about the generalising that can solve for all the problems that I think it's still the same. If we try to explore what has happened, like people have tried to become an approaches to process the data. I mean approaches there, they will take a step approach or where the structure. With advancement in learning transformers, I think it has become much smarter, and both can be solved. If you talk about the second problem, which is like key or the document digitalisation, this is the most exploredium and document AI, and it says much better. The idea is like any of documentaries and man form is that their as female. The third is a more interesting problem It's more advanced in documentary what you understand the equations, metatforms. There have also been research on how you could interret chart data, right? And some as sub task, you can processesput and some of the convert tooria representation of. was simplified CS b I, is to human behaviour. you can well and answer. But for a machine that the day of this region. Just to support to the wrong as real sense that have come of the national., we talks different document components from different areas, medical journals, documents, just to promote more thorough understanding of these documents. is strong fact, which overcome the ligations from the existing data sets, because the other data sets were panded to for tax. They had document images and annotations on top of the last semantic document compents, which limits the application on NLB basically, because they did not have a vocal level of annotations. But this is that ProTA TSS, I think now include your texts in the image and this. And I think just, I think one of the senses as we started, we started with a simple text or, but now 19 multiels and trade together to give you that level of. Earl simple rule in the case which worldw and structured of the. But over the journey and we are approaches, these journey based approach and transformers have gone into the base, and they have solved this problem to an extent view. see a lot of products, a lot of AI going in understanding of. Just to take away that we should have, houses space has demoled. As I mentioned, we started on the left side, only with the simple next basis. how toalthy models that to attack what the other entities would be. It was well butast documents are complex that it did not suffice. So we started hoping to lay out and say how you are in the body const information, how the information is facial position, that also became important in some of the recent model. But it was still not there. Till the time, there came transformmers, which would merge all theput text, layout as the image to learn deep dependencies and not for interactions between all the. And that's where the traditional state of art, lay tells me to be more and so. It's all to exist extent very complex task for different different documentary. But what was the challenge there, right? You were doing good traditional machinery for theA. But where it on it was art was, you need to have an all of data, will modelels for specific documentized, specific task for. to geography, which is not scalable, like, for a global enterp. Even if you build on as much data there will probably be complicated, then you would end up writing more customer rules who become more cases. How for the problem of generalisation? There are many differences. OCR cases can even more ter and complex obtain a model production and changes a template where you get a new document, your system works for. When Jenny A provides a rob commmission to all these approaches, they have viz requires a lot of less annotating data. They are robvers to any time takeoff. And moreover, the GI comes with the r and expert understanding. from the that any anymore to simify any else that. I do through example what has been the landscape in this area, not most this problem of the four simple innovations. One was, rather than using complex information for, how use the text and a patient body, just data. You also spatial. idea means where many transformers combine the spatial and layouties. to the across moderncl. Many in Vegates transformers and other stuff are to be something organised in the next October. But you imagine in a doctor's is like,I is warm, it's not emotionally going to be lockdown. That kind of go. So that's where they came up with being not just the next year, it was theation forers. It worked very well for our data formula. And finally, has been a and get respond in such a data that that the least find. And this has been a veryformative approach. I all the approaches and really complicated bying on this etc. on the I skip this plan, but I talked about this people GBV. know that we make a lot ofents that we presentation that we have kind of reporting met, because people to science of a lot of information in the American science. And it becomes like, when you in the understand understanding of options, how do you process these tables have more effective and autom. And by tables are different, text is like one. But when you talk about camera data, it's a damual data, you have rules andumes. And traditionally elements are not clean for. They are on large corros. So they lack that in the. simple approaches that was proposed by Microsoft Air was why can't you come up with such min for rather than giving it just a response. And a response is my on the response. And that my, and talk about something. Horizontally, they are very good 92 hours more than 9 performance. That's when it gave the power out. Table transsformers. different of how inter temperature. understandable difference. understand the information data, half of the key information that would extact for all the that., you guys did some of those,uments. I think I gained the read to talk about. These agents can be paid to a lot of travel. can be engineering that will be solved in very, I mean, I just and having talked and
