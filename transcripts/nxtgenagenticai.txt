 Recently, and I had a chance to do a forecast on AM. And he actually said something very interesting I want to recall. So he said that for the last 12 years, you know, we have been last government organisation at your, realised more viol by managing their infrastructure for them securing their infrastructure for them, and also rescuing most of them from microcers. Lord of tech organisation end up doing fundraisising to pay for them out and we are proud that that's not the case with us. So he said that till now we' win impacting the Enterrise. And his aspiration for the next decade they said, how to be impactances of the. And that took back and it was going to like, what we are agree with any is the n that he asation for the sin. And this human by creating impact for all sens within the b. So I take a lot of pride in all. So coming end, which is the topic of previous discussion. It is our agent AI ecosystem, which you see to experience, you've seen that the and you know, there have been sessions by R and. But there's a mission we after and in principle and I wanted to say that as an estence before we get started and people. The first important thing taking from our power was that you want to do ensure that we have a sovereign order to all theri those smarties that are there. Every time you like it or not, we use TGVD forlexity, any of these models are are famous in the world. We are unfortunate compromising our principal destiny of India, because we are sending to take out outside. Right? So the first thing we thought is, is there a way where you can make a sovereign one and make it fast? And the beauty of our open social technology is that is prima facing, value to the sol again. Open source allows your fake modules withloyed, localised at data, apply the local data, and insure that it. So we take a lot of pride that end sovereign, and if sovereigns because the local source technology. Second thing, you want to do was how do you make AI? I know we've h three four years, a lot of five gener react. But Buddhist through the entered, and to Enterprises, all these, meaningful we are generating test to tell my boss that I'm running late. When my engineers tell me that they are running a date for a split, I get a very professional here these days, because generated by one of the I want. How we? That was the second principle which we get propopia in mind. Hupopia in, Then you realise that there is a beautiful open social technology that has come out for react, another key word in the industry. We decided that back from being, the foundation of technology and frameworks, that allows us to really do somethingation for our gener technology. So we created an open, very extensible framework that supports both API recognition and exing compativibility. So what this does really is that people who existing websites, applications, and at the end services, can very easily integrate with them with very, very well. Once this happens, you already have a mature of experience through the platform that we have. Now, all this sounds great, but if there is not meaningful partnerships, meaningful integrations, and ambition cannot do those things which make it useful for you beyond just ex generation. So we are very proud. You would have seen Raja Neon the people who were here on Day one, we have seen Ran a new motor and we spoke about how, I think you was sparkling with us. They actually managed the global travelingmentary of airlines,els. So we are trying to build something very, very special with them in the travelling industry. But it doesn't end there. We have many combinations with Union ministries, PSUs, large enterprises, and of course, you want to operate citizen service. So it's a very principled and aspiration of approach and we are very, very proud and excited to be and marking on that journey again. little bit deeper from a technology science for is that obviously enh of a massive cluster of S 200s, we've built a very high form cluster at theest. We have very proud of that. And it's built for population scale condrency, which means that we are ready today to actually serve the nation. The beauty of an ancientic platform that we have built is that we can adapt to the growth that is there in the ocean source. which means that today, we are using the state of the art using model to answer all reasoning question is any of you ask. But tomorrow, the open of community can serve us with a new one and then bring us. So one core component of M is that there is a large reasoning model to axi answer of queries not quries, mathematical queries, or reasoning based classers. We actually have arillive parameter coding modelization as well. So what M does is that the moment you ask the qu he decides which its norm to lose to answer the question. So if any of you are out the order and say, hey, maybe this ABI, make me the web page, anything, it will actually go and allow your own 2541. which is very, very exciting. And by saying to live parameter is only one so most of you are to guess what. There is also a state of the art mix of expert model, which we use as a router to actually make this decision as to which tool or which model of go. this kind of creates a broad, you know, framework of modern centre behind it that actually powers the rest of theations. This is a look at the architecture of, and what is that call call out is, whether it is in models, whether it is a speech, microsoices, whether it is a routeing, and whether it is a tool that a screen, everything is always first and it is put together by a originalary. So we have the advantage of building this around the road those communities and sc. Abhis a grades are going to the right'm not going to go with your mouth. Why you? I was very important is that is not just a scandal on platform or model or to charge and E forlexity, which you can be proud of, and say that you really have something here that is already at far. And I'm not afraid to say it on the stage. I want you to cry as well. For them, I don't find. I as a large family of various different applications that agent in used cases, which actually create the most applications out of the technology. Whether it is sh collaboration and enterprise, where you have indigated intellions and then, whether it is business agents that actually two tasks on your behalf whether it's customer service, marketing is ID support. Canadian voice basically usually include your system is to over actions. But it is end board because actually a cloud dri, where you can store in share files, but reaction veze all of the files and up and create them in a format where you can deadly eitheract with your files and AI. You build a AI file space with your soundtrack. So you have files of checks, and you have your dance, where you talk to your files compare files and extract insides from it right away. We bring for finance and community proper to the study finances here already. But we took lacks and relax of data, relevated to topics. and as we did lots of retail the way activeplay. A little bit of fight training, and also used grraft rash technologies to build a very robust, supercharged assistant for financial property and professionals. Now, if youated professionally, you can use it or your departments to enterpational users. We build a tool hiding order that actually use st screen, score the resume, and also asked elephant questions to ensure that you have a screening gun. And in interview interview only the right thing. And we also have en. I want to call out 1.5 recording, which is the state will be so much, because I take care of the product engineering your attention is that we've be able to reduce our engineer experience and by 50%, we do it 50% quicker because we have a recordinging. andoting and speed automates the entire coding process and off it down just to increase based process. So now you have a sophisticated engineer of understand technology. They can use encoding with natural language and ask for the specific tasks. And it doesn't just now put a st of, it can actually control your boarding intern. So it's switch your feet are your V4 and they've also made the CI version as well. So it also have nort India, which is soveering to and the other, and the other tools around. So what gives us describe is that with open source, with solid infrastructure, they're able to make such powerful, impactful products that are born gr for the Indian market, and that are too powerful in there. And all meat are tr, you should come to our booth and say. There are many more coming here. This is just the time. You won't believe it, but this is just the matter of the last year or so before that you find a lot of time with that being that giving them access to highpowers you giving the structure, but there's a lot of smoke coming. and you should leave your eyes up. So it would be fun if we saw some of them on stage. So that's why I wishhe police engineering in the help me demonstrate. Would you like to see that? Yeah. Super cool. So we are going to be because of time. We're going to be showing something cool on air, not just examation, because I told you that. And we wouldn't appreciate finance and we were going to be seeing M more. So let's talk to the NO. B. So here's the increase for that, okay, if you't I use this. want to show you letters very basic. We have a cloud business, we want to show you service for our customers. We are going to use and bring my voice, we are on a platform or a sweet. Let's do it. Hi. Can I permission a virtual machine, please? I'd be happy to help you provision a virtual machine on by next. Let's get started First, we need to choose the configuration for your virtual machine. We have four options, small than two4s, for GB RAM and 20 GB storage, medium with four4s, AGB RAM, and 40 GB storage, large with eight4s, 16 GB RAM, and EGB storage for extra large wores, 32 GB RAM, and 160 GB storage, which configuration would you like to choose? Please take the number of group of four configuration. You've chosen the. We need to seap and operate system for your virtual machine. We offer Davian the Linday server, on the Linux, with lensus, Microsoft Windows, red hat, Sentos, and Rocky Linux, which operating system would you like to install. Okay, you You've chosen Brad Hat as you' operating system, read that versions available are 80 and 9.3. What version of Red? What you like to install? Can you Well, you've chosen right back as you' operating system and the latest version available is 93. You've selected the medium configuration. Now, we need to decide on the public ID for your virtual machine. How a public IT allows your virtual machine to be acceptable from the internet. Do you need a public ID for your virtual machine? Please respond with yes or no. Yes, please. You've chosen to have public vacing for your virtual machine. Now, we need to decide on the bandwidth for your virtual machine. You can choose any positive number between between one and 1000 megits per second. What bandwidth would you like to allocate? You've chosen the medium configuration with Rat 93 of publicIT, and send me, first back in with. Is this correct? Please confirm. Yes, that's absolutely correct. Speed, BN Provision A started. Your virtual machine requests on SpeedP by nextgen has been cle for provisioning the estimated that time is just a few seconds, and instance, provision aren't proper. something weird time. with voice and agent AI the AB Kumar management. In just a second, Assistant engineering being as good as. BM one being up. If we see some of details details that ch on major configuration, which is a 4V views, AG, and I chose Bandit of N andPS. I chose the Red Hack 9.3OS and you can see over India. And I chose the public that is mystein public. I think for every single information, absolutely accurate just of my voice, okay? So everything can do a lot more than just can voice, okay? Let's go to the next one. Okay? Let's look at M for a second. So I don to this is 9 on file some good share and cloud you you keep on your talking. So it does that doesn't pay job. I can use it like your board pay back on your files, quite imagine in being, right? Let's say, we just go to one of the documents, and walk for all five, right? It wasM X, BPD, anything. And we just give some guys. Our sister, in the matter of the second, will generate the entire summ of the document. Right? And it is getting from. It's not a new documents. It is giving us what, what is the context information, and so on and so forth.. But this is okay. able to do it, we' extracting it quickly in the background and we also be able to summarise. We have actually created an entire combination in the face, on top of all of your compments. Imagine an elegant, but built on top of all your data. Right? So I have uploaded an RSP document before because I sometimes with my name on RP proposals. So maybe, I can ask something like something without message. What document really is. Can you tell me what are the important dates I need to remember from that? So we're going to ask you that. and let's see if I identify the document and guess any answers from that topic. So it has identified the document. As you can see, it's sims focus group that that's why is the ar in the airport. So it's has some important data. Now, what important use the en criteria, if you want to actually, you know, find it. So let's find out tell me about is criteria going to maxipate in this. Now, neither you nor Adam seen this document is now, but we're edit it inside so easily, right? So perfection, now and more of the m, looking at the document, what is here. And there you go. He's telling us, scmy andex, what are today to drink pieces that we need to look at? And as likeria stand. So he's talking about, ISO compliance, he's talking about environment, government bodies, he's talking about having.. Having a settlement? He's talking about having him. So can you things of some of the Can you know grocery store just one like? I use this like a to then create my art to response for the ide tell me one of the important things that you respond in create solution, right? So where does want to ask AI itself that I mean, says would tell us, okay? It says find a, why.. Sometimes they man, that's okay. Fine. So we can quickly go to info finance, but you get the gist, we can actually take key head back and select the documents. able to do that. Yeah. And just say an approved road for me to respond to the science. Generally, you guys, you have seen theatres, right? So hopefully it was the time in the side. There. Okay, th sh you doing it, okay? It's as the object is it's giving us an understanding of the screen and what your art speed and how to speed go ahead and it go, there and so on.. So yourelligence or top not too many you do so much. Which finance, I model the finance profession, finance. It's not likeVD. I mean, it is very, very welled on lots of financial data. On years of cases in GSD, I, is sp around the CAO of TA is very specific models that does great financials. So we have a question that you know, I have a company financancing to India and you to expand to organisation to Australia. What are the losing laws that applied to me? And also give me some other similar cases sets you can do do access to so much data from the background that we trade on, right? So as you see now, it's generates the response and you're setting on what is the regulated train about that govern a expandria because it's been playing out of. usicial presidents that illustrate about that, because we' taken all of these specences and actually take on on that, right?
