in the world that. So I up the of us and we are some snaps from our ch. It just like mech we did customers.  You can see that people are viewing far few profes, are seeing higheras against the trails, and are spending a lot less time on applications. We believe this brings the joy, you know, like back into the recruiting, and saves retrovers time by jing them to focus on the most relic aspects of their job. Excuse me the more tactical aspects to.  Why do we here? So I learn about about how we went this and some magnance we've learned, hopefully we use to figure as well. So the first thing is, God quifies an agent design, separation of responsibilities is very, very important.  So arrangement is re actually have a higharch of agents. It's not one like hierarch. So we have a supervisers.  It's agents under the. It's almost like the day an orart a structure between the. It the corporate workplace, agents also work quite a bit like that.  So we have a comfortable supervisor, we have Aden for sourcing. We have agents for calibration, we have agents for inmates. We have have.  So the flow inside each is super high, look something like this. They just give it a, goes to a bloody place, a dance, it runs and it a loop, and it takes running and running and running till it gets an out. Sometimes you won't get the answer.  It'll have to three points. Some time, we will have to ask humans. I see this presentation.  So the other important thing is to build and expose skills to interact with other systems, because the entire top of an eight is to get it to do work in order to do work, it asks the interact on other. So how are you through things today, will be good skills? You can probably other as well, but skills are slightly different from those and.  So, then is function coll, right? Where scales are, scales are encapsulating the w and also the hump. And they can take major shapes and drops.  R disease, and various, other agency, try to model agency of skills, an agent asks another agent to do some work. MCP is emerging as a defacto standard here. So one of the things that you realised early on and we built the skills stuff before NCB came about and right around also support NC, in fact, we importance.  In the that you trying to register all the skills in a registry, and after that, the source improves exposed the skills, rather than have Adrian have the skills, the source of proves have the skills, and the agents, identify these skills by calling over the registry and all the skills are advertised, and they go the skill. Now, the beauty of the approach is that it actually provides agency. It may be very connecting hard there, the system agency then in order for the system to haveency, it needs to be able to the we discover these skills where just become and move.  Then, beautiful need to have, then you go to their mem, right Otherwise in the can't remember, and filize you. People have this the baseline expectation is it one of the things to learn from our early g product experiences that. So if you look at the controlled story, the turns on fairly stapeless, right?  So you the traditional layer to remember your enr and this is how it works, right? Your respones are updated andurately with later. Very simplistically.  But, in order for the statue work, you need to pronounce hoping and n. So at the level, you have working called as working memory. This is only for that section in the form of your conversation history, the context of your particular task,, below it, since long term, memory, which is very beyond that session.  This can beodic because the process series of related sessions. It can also be procedural. This is very powerful. and open-ed agentic system do not want to run the LLMs again and again to do the same things over.  If you remember that task race properly, you can reuse it. as opposed to rec computing. So this ads like terminism, I'm also the same on your cost latency quite significantly. Under the bottom you have, what is called collective memory. typically spans across users, spans and across neck sessions.  For example, in the case of the hiring the system, it could be that, hey, recroiters and company X follow this art process. It's something we learn over time and means so again. Then you arement scale, because ultimately the system running in production.  And the real re for scale with these in time to market is to operortunistically reuse workwords. So how do you plan and execute tasks that scale? Classic systems from those horizontal scal, right?  But you got to be careful, because you' classic distributal systems problem returned in the quiz. What's the problem? What's?  And the problem is the same, right, in any distrib system. You got to maintain distribute state, the system is wrong with your machines.. You' also part of song or hard.  You also part of eth. But put it in, you really all nonistic. This is the p.  It's more compated than money. So the idea is, rather than we saw all the problems from Rha, build about b estate systems. So you can see some of the systems this here, you added the same layer out of work that in agent where these are about make the still production uses.  The other is to be to optimise the right space. by the m I as I get to know. Because sometimes you make not even need any animals. If you have procedally record,mission does hard be an ind reasoning.  Go to a modelling. This might work. And even if you do not want to write that code yourself, you can get a model to that.  Way cheaper, way faster, way more difficultomistic. So don't use a model for everything. And even if you want using, look at your quality scale and my latency constraints for intoosing the model.  Do you want to commercial model or you want to custom model? This is like the moder customisation in a bit of your hierarchy of me, however you want to call it. So at the way at the bottom is what I recommend everyone start off at right, Villilla prom engineering, retrieve amented generation, maybe cash off into generation.  That's it. They should satisfy most of the cases. Now if that does not work, you won't, you've take into the same order and you make fine.ative, there are different tings here to do like fine tuning, something that is emerging quite a bit of the world right now is fine tuning is based on rainfor learning.  It's prettytty popular. Now in that also doesn't work, you can do work, because you can go to people.. This is the fact that you're pay your order.  Again, you may be very tempted to say, oh, my God, I'm going to pay my fourth order for scratch. No. Don't falling that pitfall.  It's really expensive, all the mortels are involving fast. Start the bottom. Go up the chain, only if you have any.  Human in the r, see this art period of this yet, as because we like them. So you ask the sign for people to do. Now, like what would you use through in the room?  And I guess soon, right? So the first test, they ensured a cur, then they arerolled and cite, especially for sensitive action is very important. And the third is active learning c. is feedback and the is it gets better over a period of time.  Good eentic systems, learn from the human, they learn from the environment and they improve over time. So it's very important to prepare for your intervention. Classic compute is extremely synous.  Disreputeed but it's still synchous because systems are talking that systems. Here you have a human in the middle who have painted up and it's really hardful put an SA on humans. So you started doing sort of, you realise it's unclear or you need approval, you need short for a human, you have proven for the human to respond.  And after the human responds, you have to continue computing. Yes. What this means is that you absolutely need to have a system which can force me and which can resume and start executing after an arbitrary amount of fight.  All the system's architecture will UI, your controls those, half prot for this human in the roof. So humans can a small man they want. You have to use US sp, classic part to send a notification to a human that dream for the users in a spot.  And you have to building for this event during the. You cannot assume syncness compute., this is just like thising. Only thing you're working with in ign deterministic system, so you have to have very regularous evaluations.  So the idea is you have to combine humans and Asians to utilise the best of both. Humans are good for defining policy and scoring things initially to say they't know what this is good. And after that, we throw some automation I to scale right?  Humans are also work at capturing nuance and subjectivity, something that Asians still struggle with. So generally what we do is we have influence, capture nuance, provid guidelines, and again, the automat escape, right And all of this, since you're already going a huge dataatide, you need really good cooling to visualise the results and take action. You want to see aggregate friends, you want to see edge cases, you want to see what program.  Otherwise, it's like hunting for an le in a hump. It's very hard. So evaluations are really more than functional quality, right?  You have to look at trust, safety, security, responsible AI, especially when doing something as an accessible and important as recruiting, which is, you know, primary modelization is doing, we need to be extra category. Also, you've got to b for optionalality. If you look at the space, it's moving really, really fast.?  So you've got to be like nim and flexible, which is, open standards, as I said, there was no MCP that your skills, so we build skills right now we have MCP, so we are right to raise MCB. I'm also trying to buy or adopt rather than the intended group to bail everything in housing. And like last but not least, you do not want to invest in expensive refactring of your application in this space is moving so fast.  So invest in the right abstractions to isolate your business so that we can move as fast as possible. So if edge was nitrated using charge GVD, but it shows that different like dancing, which is not how you should be thinking how marketing is. It's a pretty complex system but to make it you know, like nimble and sort of make it dance.  That's it. I have my QR4 then, you want connect on.. Let's go.  How? God. Not having use of value use an response.
