When we look at the adoption of agency AI is analy group of concepts are actually into enterp adoption And more, very few initiatives, less than 20, 25%, are actually that expected. Why Why does that? Is it because of theology? We believe about how we AI physical are very. But we find there are reasons why people are still not getting the full? First, it is cyberlementation. Today, people are appointing these agents in silos or specific tasks without connecting them because we all function and departmental goals and enterprise. Second, if you understanding. And because of which these agents are taking actions, they are not fitting in their real world. And both of these combine these to what we call as context blindness. Your AI systems and solutions are as good as the context in them. And today, a lot of these solutions do not get and capture the proprietory institutional knowledge, the Mo and the processes, and can. And last of the weeks, there is an integration gap. A lot of companies and enterprises are not thinking proactively as to how they are going to integrate these solutions to other enterprises, like R, CMS, or CN. And without that, what you get is isolated actions without outcomes, right? So how do we move and shift from this silone stand under the world to a more seless and context event cons. When we started thinking about this problem, right, said, okay, let's just map how people are developing solutions today and what's the framework which we can look at? So we came up with this framework on the Y ais is the crossword to purchose on the status intent which we are really dangerous city, right? Now, this could be a faster product launch, or this could be better otherwise from new marketing initiatives. And on the X taxis is the context in the integration meaning we need to feed into your system to achieve that person, right? So you can look at this on the left most, is what we call as task specificificyan. You know, you are using a AI to write a piece of code. You are using AI to talk to summarise an optument. Now, this does not require much contest, right? Tell that I'm awful enough to do this. But the impact is also just an individual producting, right? Then organisions are moving to what we call a case specificacts. We define a particular use case. In this case, it could be campaign measurement, right? So you need to provide a little bit more context. What's the det of your campaign measurement, what dec typical to, what is the process you want, right? And then not this likely more because we are able to potentially gain fast and better decisions. Then things start becoming more interesting. When you start marketing personas. You take a market here, for example, or you take a and you say, okay, what is the in the line of the marketing? What decisions do they need to take? What actions do you need to take, right? And then you order your EII solutions around that. And hence, you have obviously provide more to them, but there's also a bigger back which they can bring to our message. Now, things start getting more important interested because eventually, these personals areacting in other personas in context for certain pros and processes, right? This is where a lot of organisations struggle, what we call as workflow specific AI. How do you understand the nativities of the process? How do you bring all of that context and say, persona A is going to impact B? And how do I replicate that in my AI solution? And the last, what we are design as is to make AI. This is where you start thinking at your function on or a department level at a system level. And you say, my goal is playing these marketing RI from my ind digital channels by, say, 25%. How do I define that an AI system, which app? It's obviously a combination of variant birth, persona, personal associ, and tasks, but they need to to come together in the context of the system. And that is going to start movinging and shifting from what we call AI whichitches focussed on actions, to AI which is vocals on outcomes. So how do we think about it, right? And that's where we introduce this holistic framework, which we call systemic AI. For us, it is about utilising AI in the context of existing physical meeting systems with many problems and AI agents includ purpose and context to believe on the impact, right? So that's how we move about to the AI. There are certainly principles of which we have designed this brainwork and everything, right. The first is, you need to start thinking functions first. systems first. That has to be that we is that isions, right? Second year, you have to start changing AI process design. If today, you are doing A BC, it's not just about making a better betterC. Maybe you don't need the study, or maybe it's ADLC now, right? So how do you start thinking in an AI medium planet? Third, how do you ensure cross functional collaboration and orchestation? Those things have to be be built into the design of your system and not as an after. Both, very importantly we talk about this a little bit more is dynamic context and learning. Life is we spoke about, context is the case, unless we provide the right context to these systems, they will not give you the right actions. But at the same size, the context is dynamic. Work flows in a organisation arch all the time. Market time sur, government regulation are changing. All those things have to be brought into the system in a dandemic manner. Four audits can be discussed deep integration to the system systems, and you have to think about an up in. At last you're from the outside. As you are implementmenting these systems at an enterprise v we have to start thinking of, without the right governance, the systems will not scale and it will fail at some point in time. Okay, so how do you go about building this, right now? So today you look at this, there are four, four building blocks of any large scale enterprise system. The first is what we call the family there. This is where you are really increase spaces, the applications, the interfaces, which are actually interacting with the intelligence and are integraces with your decisions to get to a mystic outcome, right? Now, this layer is what taps to what we call as the poor leg. This is your poor intelligence layer. This This is where your stickers, your models, and your agents are. This is what is produced in a very maximum the, And at the bottom, and in fact, I would say the beddrop of all of this is the foundational layer of context and data. This is where all of the data are actually understanding what to do, how can we seem less to the fund action to the next action, right? How to leave all of these things. So this is what that's why we call it the foundation is here. As government all of these three years is the strategy of the government. The key thing here is you have to think of governance at each building clock separately, because there is a separate purpose point, right? So if you are at the value there, your purpose is to allign your AI investments, give your organisation strategy, to define the right use cases, to define the right R one to create the right proposes, and follow policyies around how AIA will be adopted in your organ transition. If we are thinking of governance at the core layers, we have to start thinking how to I standardise age in behaviours here. Because if agents are going to run with their end of time, they better follow some norms, right? So how we ensure that that we have a comply decision gating process on a. And at the calcul lay, it's very important to ensure data and context integrity, as well as trustworthiness. Otherwise, nobody can trust your system. So the kind of governance models unique at the foundation there are very different, right? So let's make this a little bit more real with the reference architecture diagram, right This is how you scientificically a large organisation should build their system A, right? On the top is the valer with your leadership, your man is basically your users. are impractic business systems. Now these interactions could be through j, to dash course, to verifations, right? Is that you asking question. The first thing any system does it, it goes to what we call the brain of the system, which is the orchestrator. This is the layer which actually decodes and understand the brain. It first goes to the context layer. say again, do I have enough context. Can I actually answer this question, right? And that's what the context becomes very important. So once the context layer gives enough information to the object,strator, it starts in focussing other agages. And that's what they basically call the ages to agent program, right? Now, these agents could be very, like a document for agent, or a se equal to tensation. or they could be more complicated agents. You could actually get a price stages. They understand for theation, right? It depends on the level of sophistication you want to bring in invations. And in them, these agents are actually sitting on these LLM models, which today to be very honest with the most commoditized educated the. Everybody has access to these models, they are open source, you can buy them. It is the same for everybody. What means is this whole system really. first is, how much you finding the interface and how are you reagining this process. Second, how are you doing the art treatment? Because that's the brain of this system, right? And third, the context here. This is what makes AI and difference from any other out. And let you say actual things in your context. Okay. Now the question comes from, when they start often available. How do I go about deciding who wants to buy a food, right? So to make it slightly easier if we have in the, right, right? The bottom was be working more individual productivity and research for technology, and, complexity, clouds on the world, right? They have sign from individual ts like this spoke about around here. They are most five, they are many in them available. You don't need to build them in house, right? The second is where to city starts in eas is what we call function specific task. In my here, I want to create a task. I want to do a task with my a system. Now, what you see a lot of the existing average players, like salesforce was, they are coming out the solution because they, they are very standards in class. What becomes trick or interesting is a lot of coitations have custom task today, which are not built to any of these reactity systems, right? The that's where you need custom AI solutions to to class. And last lay on the top is the most complex you have so many worldflows, so many things which are happening as this passage level. At the on the station level, where these tasks have to be back to each other, like we spoke at a system level. And that's what we call theow and complex tasks. And this is they have forms. We have. AI, right? So you have to create a four AI system. Not as master, you would be out of on the top of the middle end. We work with companies as their AI programp. A, ourform, which is very flexical to bring in all of these technologies into theform. And we believe you need to think of it as a program and not as an individual. So let's talk a little bit. I'll give you a video today on our toolformOS. We have been working on NS for the last five to six years. And today I amm very proud to say it's the AIform which can executed to the vision of system A. As you interview US, what what you see the first thing on the inside is your own customs free, where you can actually prepare this apps who would like to access it. You have access to an app Store, it's more than thousand applications, which have been by and for the last five days. These are applications catered to specific business problems.ation. You have EI can ask or you can just automate certain task, right? Now, the most interesting part of thisform is a guns from the payform. So let me dive into that for a second. This is how the paperform is broken on design. It's built on three studios. These studios align with the vision on the building blocks like just. On the lamp t, what you see is that the studio this is where you can build your data models, you can run data qualityos. You even get own data list. where you can use AIE assessments to search any data which is availableailability to your organisation. All these features are AI natives built in. In the middle is what we call the AI. From the bottom to the top, very interesting, we have built on context. we can build your own autization context in one place. And this connects with data grades AWS, smoothly, whatever you might have your data. So you can make make all of that data in one place as a context to be in New York, AI solutions. And then you have an ability to connect various LLM. There's an ag in marketplace we have many and high agents. And then what you see on the line is the decision studio. I think I right is This is based actually builds applications with business standards. So you can build your AIS. one example to make it because maybe few organisations be believed are introducing AIE to business processes. So I'm going to take an example of an process than just clear what you can see is we have all the business processes in the CP industry where we have created custom applications. And what I do with I'm going with the last one is management. Once I put here as a metre grow management function, this is industry, you land land on this stage. What you see on the soft length here is an initiative, which is getting through softwareation. What you see here are the key ABI in which unique to science as the head of the RT group, right? Now, the interesting thing that you see ADIs have been forced by EI imagesages from strategy documents which will uploaded the context floor. and you can plug and play and change these EI the plug, right? That's the right side to what you see is insights generated by AI agents, in a context of those. They are not having anything not inside the right. The agents can understand what is and they are generating insights on their own. And then very first on the left hand side, here, what you see as divers, these are teams who are working under their old RGM Australia, right? The pricing team promotions to, distribution, and they are individual actions which are connected to each other. So if I cl on pricing here, what I' able to see and the go of the fighting function is all the key tasks I need to achieve in my day today life, right? Let's go in one of the tasks. say right. Once you create this the entire decision flow of what you as the rers of that licing function needs to do is mapped out here. You can create a tool suspective decision tools, visit just a standard tool foreigning executives. And interestingly, what people see here is, what steps are done and what do you do to do next. in this case, you will see that we need to simulate crises at the next day and the function. So you can go in particular class, you can give the lic and law, and what you give all the options that you will to do to come eng this class. Now, this has a big called my first solution, because what we believe is to us in the face for it and not just be the day. So when you keep out this ref solions here, what will came from does it, it will bring out all the solutions which are available to us, which we have built for this flight as well a solution, is within other apps, like we can in forces. And we can go to any of these apps from the single form and then it could be blacks action. Now you won't say, where is Jenny Allen this? So we can always decide to be p pililing. So what we have also learn there is we are basically pilots and good states on the town of all of these solutions. So you don't even need to provide any of these solutions, you can just ask the question, if youate prices for the second time period, and the JI agent will run its credit. It will give you all the parameers it you need to run. You can actually change these parameters if you want, and you can just sort of simulate and it will will get all the expected steals in the satanics, right? So once you' done with this task, you can go back to this, you can monit all the simulations you have done. And when you go to to the rollout part of it, it indicates directly to other systems, where all of these spices are. So just process, like pricing, we have a similar decision grow of theotion, the and all of those actions, right? But the idea of doing this was this is how the diggeons of how you get into the end. It take to take decision, leaving, and processes, and not build EI in isolation outside. So with that sense this wrap up, you keep from business, right? The first we start thinking at a system then. That's where your thinking should start, right? Designed with a universe and construction to mind sets and reatter your processices. Don't go by this.imating the same processes that you have to make. Third, context is made, without context, none of this is yours. It's just a generate and it's not giving the RY. Four think of governance as a foundational thing. You cannot stay it at an enterprise level without printing governance. At last, start fast and and build it in modular factions. You don't have to build their. You just have to design and create at system. Did that have a wrapper? This is the QR boat building an action download a mic paper on systematic action, and you can also request a workshop, vo and details ofus and other digestions. Thank you.
